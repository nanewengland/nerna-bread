# nerna-bread

## Description

"nerna-bread" is a fork of the "bread" BMLT meeting list generator.  It allows for the creation of a meeting schedule from a BMLT server.

## Problem

Our printer has really specific needs, bread doesnt support those needs currently so we must use this fork. All changes from the original bread plugin can be found by searching patrick, as I had made comments everywhere I made a change. 

Most these changes revolve around the use of spot colors.

## Installation

 Drop this directory into the "wp-content/plugins/" directory and activate it.
